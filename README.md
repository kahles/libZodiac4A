# libZodiac
framework providing functionality for building a lunar calendar

This library was created while working on [Mondtag](https://github.com/kahles/mondtag), a lunar 
calendar for Android.

This is the android fork - for pure java, see the plain java repository 
[libZodiac](https://github.com/kahles/libZodiac).

### Requirements

#### Java 8
I decided to use JDK8, even though it isn't fully supported by Android yet. E.g. `java.time` is only supported through a backport for 
Android.

#### gradle
A [gradle](https://gradle.org) build script is included to manage dependencies and automate testing and building. The plugin 
[gradle-android-git-version](https://github.com/gladed/gradle-android-git-version) is used to automate versioning based on git and also 
works well in a non-Android java project.

#### libnova
Astronomical calculations are done with the help of [libnova](http://libnova.sourceforge.net/) by Liam Girdwood.
There is a "1:1" java port [novaforjava v0.15.0.0](http://novaforjava.sourceforge.net/) by Richard van Nieuwenhoven, but this can't be used
for multi-threaded calculations.
So I made a fork containing a fix for this: [nova4jmt](https://github.com/kahles/nova4jmt).

#### JUnit 4.12
I'm trying to provide a reasonable test coverage using [JUnit](http://junit.org).

#### slf4j
For logging I decided to use [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/), because it has many backends including one for Android logging.

### Import
#### gradle
```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    /* For snapshots:
    maven {
        url =  'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
    }*/
}

dependencies {
    compile 'de.kah2.zodiac:libZodiac:0.9'
}
```

#### maven
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>de.kah2.zodiac</groupId>
  <artifactId>libZodiac</artifactId>
  <version>0.9</version>
</dependency>
```

### Usage
- [`CalendarExampleSimple.java`](src/test/java/de/kah2/libZodiac/example/CalendarExampleSimple.java) shows basic usage of this framework.
- [`CalendarDataStringBuilder.java`](src/test/java/de/kah2/libZodiac/example/CalendarDataStringBuilder.java) shows how to access data. 
- [`CalendarExampleStorage.java`](src/test/java/de/kah2/libZodiac/example/CalendarExampleStorage.java) shows how to create, store , load and
extend a calendar.
- [`ProgressListenerExample.java`](src/test/java/de/kah2/libZodiac/example/ProgressListenerExample.java) shows how to enable progress 
listening.
